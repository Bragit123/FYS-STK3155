# Week 47: Feedback and evaluation

## Why did you choose this course?
I wanted to learn more about machine learning, and especially neural networks.
I find the idea of making the computer "think" very interesting, and before I
decided to pursue a degree in physics I also considered to study AI.

## What was your programming knowledge before you started?
I started programming a bit when I was 14 or 15 years old when I experimented
with making video games in Unity3D (in javascript and C#), and the years after that I
also tried a bit of coding for webdesign (html, css and javascript), but not
very fancy stuff. Most of my current programming knowledge comes from the
university. I have a bachelor's degree in physics, and have coded a lot in
python. I have also done a little bit of Java (in IN1010 Objektorientert
programmering) and C++ (in FYS3150 Computational physics).

## How do you judge your own level of knowledge on machine learning before and after this course?
Before: Very limited. I knew that it had a lot to do with statistics, and I had
watched some youtube videos on the subject, but I would not be able to make any
machine learning code myself.
After: A lot better, but still limited in the sense that I still have very much
to learn. I now understand a lot more of the mathematics behind machine learning
algorithms, and how to put the algorithms to practice in code to solve problems.
I understand that there is much for me to learn still, and I am eager to learn
more in the future.

## Did the projects and the teaching material allow you to deepen your insights about Machine Learning?
Very much! Doing the projects have been a great way of learning machine
learning, since we both have to write code (i.e., put machine learning to
practice), and write a theory section on how the algorithms work (i.e., get
comfortable with how the algorithms work in depth, and learn about their flaws
and strengths).

## Project based teaching and active learning
As stated in the previous question, I have learned a lot from the projects, so I
definitely feel that project based learning is the way to go for this kind of
course. I also think it was very useful to have the lab sessions where we could
ask questions. I did not watch too many of the lectures, but the combination of reading the
material in the jupyter notebook, googling and watching youtube videos to gain
visual understanding, and practicing using what I learned with the opportunity
to ask questions to group teachers with knowledge and experience has worked very
well for me, and I believe that I have learned a lot from this course.

## Usefulness of the weekly exercises
The weekly exercises were incredibly useful, both to make sure that I did not
slack off too much between the projects, and to help me figure out what parts of
the curriculum were important, and going through this. The fact that what we did
was always useful to the projects as well is a big bonus, and much helped my
motivation to keep doing them.

## Active learning/lab sessions and lectures
I did not watch too many of the lectures, but I went to a great deal of lab
sessions, and they have been very good for my understanding of the subjects
taught in the course. The group teachers have been very helpful, and have
explained difficult topics in a simple manner.

## How would you improve this course?
The course was overall very good, but if there is something I might want to
mention, it is the jupyter notebook. Some of the code in the jupyter notebook
is a bit outdated, since we were recommended to use jax, but
the code mostly used autograd. The jupyter notebook also contain a lot of
information, so it would be nice to have a short summary of what the most important take aways
from a week is, together with some of the most essential equations/algorithms.
Also, some of the algorithms on learning rates in gradient descent were quite
hard to find in the jupyter notebook, although I found them more clearly shown
in an algorithmic box in one of the books that were linked to. Lastly, in the
code for tuning algorithms, some variables changed name. For instance, the constant learning
rate factor was called gamma one place, and eta somewhere else.

## Then some basic questions:

### Which is your preferred information channel, Canvas, Discord, mail or other?
Mail for general information from the course, and discord for discussion with
the teachers and other students.

### Was the weekly update with plans etc useful?
Yes, it was nice to have an overview of what to expect for the week.

### Was it easy to access the course material?
Yes, although some pages in the jupyter notebook were missing at times. For
instance, the page for week 44 might appear in the sidebar, but if I go to the page for week
42, only the pages up to week 43 show.

### Which resources and tools did you use? Jupyter-notebooks, GitHub, the various textbooks we have recommended, etc etc
I mostly read the jupyter notebooks, and did not use the github page or the
textbooks that much, except when I needed something specific from the textbooks,
or wanted to find where to reference something in the report. My group and I
used github to collaborate on the projects. I also looked through the discord
channels whenever I was stuck on something to see if others had asked the same,
but I was not actively participating there.

### If you did not attend the lectures or the active learning/lab sessions, which resources did you use?
Did not attend lectures, but I did attend lab sessions, and used the jupyter
notebooks a lot.
