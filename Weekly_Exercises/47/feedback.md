# Week 47: Feedback and evaluation

## Why did you choose this course?
I wanted to learn more about machine learning, and especially neural networks.
I find the idea of making the computer "think" very interesting, and before I
decided to pursue a degree in physics I also considered to study AI.

## What was your programming knowledge before you started?

## How do you judge your own level of knowledge on machine learning before and after this course?

## Did the projects and the teaching material allow you to deepen your insights about Machine Learning?

## Project based teaching and active learning

## Usefulness of the weekly exercises

## Active learning/lab sessions and lectures

## How would you improve this course?

## Then some basic questions:

### Which is your preferred information channel, Canvas, Discord, mail or other?

### Was the weekly update with plans etc useful?

### Was it easy to access the course material?

### Which resources and tools did you use? Jupyter-notebooks, GitHub, the various textbooks we have recommended, etc etc

### If you did not attend the lectures or the active learning/lab sessions, which resources did you use?

### Any other topics, impressions, ideas etc you would like to share with us?
