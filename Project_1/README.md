# Project 1
In this project we look at different models for fitting data, namely, ordinary
least squares (OLS), Ridge regression and Lasso regression. We also look at the
bootstrap and cross validation resampling techniques, and use these to evaluate
the models. In order to check the different models, we test them at the
two-dimensional Franke function, before using the same models to analyze
real-world terrain data.
