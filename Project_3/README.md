# Project 3
In this project we have analyzed the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using
three different machine learning methods: Regular neural networks, convolutional
neural networks, and decision tree boosting methods.

The *Code* directory consists of all the python programs we have used to produce
our results.

The *Figures* directory consist of all the plots we have produced.
Note that not all the plots contained in this folder are used in the report.

The file *Project3.pdf* is the complete report from the project.
